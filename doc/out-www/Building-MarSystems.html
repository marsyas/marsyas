<h4 class="subsection">4.1.1 Building MarSystems</h4>

<p>The basic idea behind the design of Marsyas is that any audio
analysis/synthesis computation can be expressed as some type of
processing object, which we call MarSystem, that reads data from an
input slice of floating point numbers, performs some
computation/transformation based on data, and writes the results to
another slice of floating point numbers.  Networks of MarSystems can
be combined and encapsulated as one MarSystem.

   <p>For example consider an
audio processing series of computations consisting of reading samples
from a soundfile, performing an short-time fourier transform (STFT) to
calculate the complex spectrum, performing an inverse STFT to convert
back from the frequency domain to time domain, then applying a gain to
the amplitude of the samples and writing the result to a soundfile.

   <p>As is very frequently the case with audio processing networks objects
the input of each stage is the output of the previous stage.  This way
of assembling MarSystems is called a Series composite.  Once a Series
Composite is formed it can basically be used as one MarSystem that
does the whole thing. A figure showing a block diagram-like
presentation of this network is shown in the next section.
