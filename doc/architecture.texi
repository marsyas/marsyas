In order to fully take advantage of the capabilities of Marsyas it is
important to understand how it works internally. The architecture of
Marsyas reflects an underlying dataflow model that we have found
useful in implementing real and non-real time audio analysis and
synthesis systems. In marsyas 0.2 a lot of things can be accomplished
by assembling complex networks of basic building blocks called
MarSystems that process data. This is the so
called @qq{Black-Box} functionality of the framework. In addition the
programmer can also write directly her/his own building blocks directly
in C++ following a certain API and coding conventions offering the so
called @qq{White-Box} functionality.  Building networks is described in
@ref{Writing applications}, and writing new MarSystems is described
in @ref{Programming MarSystems}.

@node Building MarSystems
@subsection Building MarSystems

The basic idea behind the design of Marsyas is that any audio
analysis/synthesis computation can be expressed as some type of
processing object, which we call MarSystem, that reads data from an
input slice of floating point numbers, performs some
computation/transformation based on data, and writes the results to
another slice of floating point numbers.  Networks of MarSystems can
be combined and encapsulated as one MarSystem.

For example consider an
audio processing series of computations consisting of reading samples
from a soundfile, performing an short-time fourier transform (STFT) to
calculate the complex spectrum, performing an inverse STFT to convert
back from the frequency domain to time domain, then applying a gain to
the amplitude of the samples and writing the result to a soundfile.

As is very frequently the case with audio processing networks objects
the input of each stage is the output of the previous stage.  This way
of assembling MarSystems is called a Series composite.  Once a Series
Composite is formed it can basically be used as one MarSystem that
does the whole thing. A figure showing a block diagram-like
presentation of this network is shown in the next section.


@node Dataflow model
@subsection Dataflow model

Marsyas follows a dataflow model of audio computation.

@image{images/dataflow,,5cm}

Marsyas uses general matrices instead of 1-D arrays.  This allows
slices to be semantically correct.

@node Implicit patching vs. explicit patching
@subsection Implicit patching vs. explicit patching

Many audio analysis programs require the user to explicitly (manually)
connect every processing block,

@example
# EXPLICIT PATCHING: block definitions
source, F1, F2, F3, destination;
# connect the in/out ports of the blocks
connect(source, F1);
connect(source, F2);
connect(source, F3);
connect(F1, destination);
connect(F2, destination);
connect(F3, destination);
@end example

@image{images/explicit-patching,,4cm}

Marsyas uses @emph{implicit patching}: connections are made
automagically when blocks are created,

@example
# IMPLICIT PATCHING
source, F1, F2, F3, destination;
Fanout(F1, F2, F3);
Series(source, Fanout, destination);
@end example

@image{images/implicit-patching,,5cm}


@node Implicit patching advantages
@subsection Implicit patching advantages 

Creating a neural network with explicit patching soon becomes
a mess,

@image{images/neural-explicit,,5cm}

With implicit patching, this is much more manageable.

@example
# IMPLICIT PATCHING
fanoutLayer1(ANN_Node11, ..., ANN_Node1N);
...
fanoutLayerM(ANN_NodeM1, ..., ANN_NodeMN);
ANN_Series(fanoutLayer1, ..., fanoutLayerM);
@end example

@image{images/neural-implicit,,5cm}


Implicit patching can automagically adjust the connections without
requiring any code recompiliation.  For example, we can change
the number of bands in a filter bank without changing any code.

@node Patching example of Feature extraction
@subsection Patching example of Feature extraction

Suppose we wish to create a typical feature extraction program:

@image{images/feature-extraction,,5cm}

@example
MarSystemManager mng; 
MarSystem* Series1 = mng.create("Series", "Series1"); 
MarSystem* Fanout1 = mng.create("Fanout", "Fanout1"); 
MarSystem* Series2 = mng.create("Series", "Series2"); 
MarSystem* Fanout2 = mng.create("Fanout", "Fanout2"); 
MarSystem* Fanout3 = mng.create("Fanout", "Fanout3"); 
Fanout3->addMarSystem(mng.create("Mean", "Mean")); 
Fanout3->addMarSystem(mng.create("Variance", "Variance")); 
Fanout2->addMarSystem(mng.create("Centroid", "Centroid")); 
Fanout2->addMarSystem(mng.create("RollOff", "Rolloff")); 
Fanout2->addMarSystem(mng.create("Flux", "Flux");

Fanout1->addMarSystem(Series2); 
Series1->addMarSystem(mng.create("SoundFileSource", "Source")); 
Series1->addMarSystem(Fanout1);

@node Series
@subsection Series

@image{images/composite-series}


The Series composite is the most basic structure for connecting
MarSystems into dataflow networks through implicit patching. It is
similar to Unix pipes or the chuck operator in the Chuck programming
language. The output of the first object in the Series connection
becomes the input to the second object, the output of the second object
becomes the input to the third object etc. A MarSystem can potentially
have different size and characteristics for the input and output
slices. In Series connections these characteristics are constrained to
ensure that the output slice of each MarSystem is the same as the input
slice of the MarSystem that is downstream from it. The figure shows how
a Series composite can be used to express a complex spectrum computation
from a windowed segment of audio. The Hanning MarSystem windows the
incoming segment and the FFT MarSystem converts the audio to a complex
spectrum. Notice how the dimensions of the slices can change at the
different stages of processing. 
 




@node Parallel
@subsection Parallel

A Parallel composite is used when you have an input with multiple
observations (i.e. channels) and you want to run calculations in
parallel on each of the observations.  This is shown in graphical form
below:

@image{images/composite-parallel}

In the above diagram, the Parallel MarSystem is fed a realvec with 3
observations (and a large number of samples).  The MarSystem F1
receives the first observation, coloured in green.  The second
MarSystem in the Parallel, F2, gets the second observation, coloured
in blue, and the third MarSystem, F3, receives the third observation,
coloured in yellow.

To build this system you would write code that would look something
like:

@example
MarSystem* parallel = mng.create("Parallel", "parallel");
parallel->addMarSystem(mng.create("Gain", "F1"));
parallel->addMarSystem(mng.create("Gain", "F2"));
parallel->addMarSystem(mng.create("Gain", "F3"));
@end example

One real-life use of Parallels is if you have a stereo sound source
and you want to run an analysis on the left and right channels
seperately.  An example of generating a spectrum for the right and
left channels of a sound source would look something like:

@example
	MarSystem* net = mng.create("Series", "net");
	net->addMarSystem(mng.create("SoundFileSource", "src"));

	MarSystem* stereobranches = mng.create("Parallel", "stereobranches");
	MarSystem* left = mng.create("Series", "left");
	MarSystem* right = mng.create("Series", "right");

	left->addMarSystem(mng.create("Windowing", "hamleft"));
	left->addMarSystem(mng.create("Spectrum", "spkleft"));
	left->addMarSystem(mng.create("PowerSpectrum", "leftpspk"));

	right->addMarSystem(mng.create("Windowing", "hamright"));
	right->addMarSystem(mng.create("Spectrum", "spkright"));
	right->addMarSystem(mng.create("PowerSpectrum", "rightpspk"));

	stereobranches->addMarSystem(left);
	stereobranches->addMarSystem(right);

	net->addMarSystem(stereobranches);
@end example





@node Fanout
@subsection Fanout

A Fanout is another composite MarSytem that, like a Parallel, contains
other MarSystem.  It differs from a Parallel in that it takes a single
observation and sends a copy of this observation to all the MarSystems
inside of it.  This is shown graphically below:

@image{images/composite-fanout}

In the above diagram, we send a realvec with a single observation (and
many samples) into the Fanout.  The Fanout then makes a copy of this
data for each of the MarSystems within in.  In the above diagram, it
makes a copy of the input observation and sends it to F1 (shown in
green), F2 (shown in blue) and F3 (shown in yellow).  

Thus, the input of the Fanout shown above is one observation (and many
samples) and the output of the Fanout is three observations (and the
same number of samples as the input had).

To build this system you would write code that would look something
like:

@example
MarSystem* fanout = mng.create("Fanout", "fanout");
fanout->addMarSystem(mng.create("Gain", "F1"));
fanout->addMarSystem(mng.create("Gain", "F2"));
fanout->addMarSystem(mng.create("Gain", "F3"));
@end example

One real-life example of using a Fanout is if you want to run many
different kinds of algorithms on your data.  For example, you might to
run a series of different filterbanks on your audio.  To do this you
would write code that would look something like:

@example
MarSystem* net = mng.create("Series", "net");
net->addMarSystem(mng.create("SoundFileSource", "src"));

MarSystem* filterbank = mng.create("Fanout", "filterbank");
filterbank->addMarSystem(mng.create("Filter", "cf8"));
filterbank->addMarSystem(mng.create("Filter", "cf12"));
filterbank->addMarSystem(mng.create("Filter", "cf18"));
filterbank->addMarSystem(mng.create("Filter", "cf20"));

net->addMarSystem(filterbank);
@end example



@node Accumulator
@subsection Accumulator

An Accumulator MarSystem accumulates result of multiple tick process
calls to internal MarSystem.  It then generates output only once when
all the results are accumulated.  It is used to change the rate of
process requests.

For example, if the nTimes control for the Accumulator is set to 6,
then each time the Accumulator receives a tick(), it sends 6 tick()s
to the MarSystems that are inside it.  This is shown graphically below:

@image{images/composite-accumulator}

One common use case for an Accumlator is if your algorithm needs to
operate on a block of data, for example, it might need to analyze a
number of frames of an FFT in order to detect a particular audio
event.  

An example of using an Accumulator could look like be:

@example
MarSystem* net = mng.create("Series", "net");

MarSystem* acc = mng.create("Accumulator", "acc");
MarSystem* accuInternal = mng.create("Series", "accuInternal");

accuInternal->addMarSystem(mng.create("SoundFileSource", "src"));
accuInternal->addMarSystem(mng.create("Windowing", "ham"));
accuInternal->addMarSystem(mng.create("Spectrum", "spk"));
acc->addMarSystem(accuInternal); 

//IMPORTANT NOTE:
//
//note that you can only add one Marsystem to an Accumulator
//any additional Systems added are simply ignored outputwise !!
//e.g. if you want to use multiple Marsystems in a row and accumulate
//their combined output, you need to put them in a series which you add 
//to the accumulator

net->addMarSystem(acc); 
net->updctrl("mrs_natural/inSamples", 512);	

net->updctrl("Accumulator/acc/mrs_natural/nTimes", 10);
@end example

In the above example, a SoundFileSource is followed by a hamming
Window, a Spectrum and a PowerSpectrum.  All of these are added to an
Accumulator, which is then added to a global Series.  The nTimes
control of the Accumulator is then set to 10.  

The output of this MarSystem would be a realvec with 512 observations,
corresponding to each of the bins of the FFT generated by the
Spectrum, and with 10 columns (or samples).  Your algorithm could then analyze this
two-dimensional matrix to look for the audio feature you are
investigating.

@node Shredder
@subsection Shredder

A Shredder composite MarSystem does the inverse to what an Accumulator
does.  While an Accumulator builds up a realvec containing the results
from multiple ticks, a Shredder splits this realvec into multiple
chunks, effectively increasing the rate at which data is output.

A toy example of using both a Shredder and an Accumulator together
would look something like:

@example
MarSystem* net = mng.create("Series", "net");
MarSystem* acc = mng.create("Accumulator", "acc");
MarSystem* shred = mng.create("Shredder", "shred");

acc->addMarSystem(mng.create("SoundFileSource", "src"));
net->addMarSystem(acc); 
shred->addMarSystem(mng.create("AudioSink", "dest"));
net->addMarSystem(shred);

net->updctrl("Accumulator/acc/SoundFileSource/src/mrs_string/filename", sfName);
net->updctrl("Shredder/shred/AudioSink/dest/mrs_bool/initAudio", true);

net->updctrl("mrs_natural/inSamples", 256);

net->updctrl("Accumulator/acc/mrs_natural/nTimes", 10);
net->updctrl("Shredder/shred/mrs_natural/nTimes", 10);
@end example

In the above example, an Accumulator is added first to a global Series
network, and then a Shredder is added to this Series.  A
SoundFileSource is then added to the Accumulator, and an AudioSink is
added to the Shredder.  The nTimes control of both the Shredder and
Accumulator are then set to 10.

This network would read in data from the SoundFileSource, and the
Accumulator would build up a buffer of 10 chunks of this audio.  The
Shredder would then take these 10 slices of audio data and would split
them back into 10 chunks, which would then be output to the
AudioSource.  

This whole procedure would be akin to buffering a section of audio 10
times the size of the number of samples that were input.  So, since we
set the inSamples of the network to 256, the number of samples output
by the Acccumulator would be 2560.

@node Linking of controls
@section Linking of controls 

THIS SECTION WAS JUST A COPY-PASTE FROM A LONG EMAIL FROM THE DEVELOPERS MAILING LIST - STILL NEEDS A BIT OF REVISION, BUT ALREADY PROVIDES IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE LINKING OF CONTROLS IN MARSYAS (lgmartins)

This refactoring is the "part II" of the last refactoring to the linking mechanism, done some weeks ago.

In the first part of the refactoring we changed the way linked controls store their values (i.e their data - a real number, an integer, a string, a realvec, etc). Before this refactoring, each control had it's own data allocation, and so everytime we changed a control's value, such change had to be propagated (i.e. copied) to all the linked controls (if any). Such a copy meant that the same data would be replicated in memory a number of times equal to the number of existing links. Furthermore, keeping all those copies in sync each time we change a control value implied a lot of copying. This was really ineficient, both computationally and memory-wise, and all the code for managing such a synchronization was a mess.

So, the first step was to make all MarControls that are linked to each other share a same MarControlValue (i.e. the marsyas object that in fact stores in memory the data in MarControls). This automatically solves the synchronization problem, although it may create some others if we start thinking about multi-treaded code in Marsyas (but let's forget about multi-threads for now).

When linking a control (let's say ctrl_A) to another control (ctrl_B), it's now just a matter of instructing control_A to start using the MarControlValue used by control_B. The old MarControlValue of ctrl_A can therefore be deleted from memory, in case no other MarControl is still pointing to it (i.e. refcounting).

To do so, in marsyas pseuso-code, we would write:

@example
ctrl_A->linkTo(ctrl_B);
@end example

Or, in case we didn't have the direct pointer to the controls, using their pathnames and the MarSystem API:

@example
msys->linkControl("mrs_xxx/A", "mrs_xxx/B");
@end example

This brings us to the first important detail: during the linking of two controls, it's important the order of the linking operation. Doing ctrl_A->linkTo(ctrl_B) will discard the current value of ctrl_A, which will now use the value currently stored in ctrl_B. If we reverse it (ctrl_B->linkTo(ctrl_A);), ctrl_B value will be discarded (we can think as "overwriten") in favour of the value of ctrl_A. This is only relevant at the time of the linking operation, and users should, if nothing else, be aware of which value the want to keep when linking two controls. Of course, after the linking is done, changing the value of ctrl_B will also change the value of ctrl_A, and vice-versa, making this detail syntatically meaningless.

However, this order of the linking operation is now stored internally by all MarControls in marsyas. And the reason for this has to do with the unlinking operation of controls. This was the work done in "part II" of the linking/unlinking refactoring, just completed today.

In the first stage of the refactoring, we were not storing anywhere the order of the linking of two controls. So we just kept a table with references to all the MarControls linked together (i.e. sharing the same value/data), without any information to who linked to whom originally.

This was quite elegant in fact, allowing to easily unlink any control from a set of linked controls by just cloning in memory its current value (i.e. creating a new but equal valued MarControlValue object), removing it from the reference table of the MarControlValue object holding its value, and re-pointing the control to, from that time on, start using the new cloned data object instead.

The problem is that in Marsyas, the most interesting use of unlinking controls is a bit more demanding. The way just described of completely unlinking a control from all the other linked controls may not be desirable at all.

Suppose the following scenario: we have a composite MarSystem (i.e. a MarSystem with other MarSystems inside, connected in series, for e.g.) where we have a control (say, ctrl_X) that we want to always link to, for example, the output control of the last child MarSystem (let's say ctrl_processedData control of the last child MarSystem). This is exactly the case of the composite FlowThru, so you can refer to its .cpp/.h code for an actual implementation. So we start by linking ctrl_X to the ctrl_processedData of the last child:

@example
ctrl_processedData = msys->getctrl("xxx/lastChildMsys1/mrs_realvec/processedData");
ctrl_X->linkTo(ctrl_processedData);
@end example

Semanticaly, this is the order that makes more sense (but nothing prevents us to do it the other way around - the link will work as well!), since we are overwriting ctrl_X's value with the current value of ctrl_processedData, which is in fact an "output" control (controls in Marsyas do not have an explicit in/out attribute - "output" controls are considered controls to which makes no sense writing to because they will be ignored and overwriten by their owning MarSystem; "input" controls on the other hand will be used internally by their owning MarSystem as parameters, but they may also be read to know the current control value currently being used).

Graphically, this link can be represented as:

@example
ctrl_processedData <--- ctrl_X
@end example

If we now need to link some other controls from other MarSystems to ctrl_X, we just need to explicitly do it:

@example
ctrl_Y->linkTo(ctrl_X);
ctrl_W->linkTo(ctrl_X);
ctrl_Z->linkTo(ctrl_W); //this control will be indirectly connected to ctrl_X, altough its link target is ctrl_W
@end example

Graphically:

@example
ctrl_processedData <--- ctrl_X <--- ctrl_Y
                            ^
                            |--- ctrl_W <--- ctrl_Z
@end example

So, after this we have ctrl_X, ctrl_Y, ctrl_W and ctrl_Z effectively all linked to and sharing the same value with ctrl_processedData, with minimal computational burden and a small memory footprint.

Now imagine that we want to add a new child to the FlowThru composite. Since we want ctrl_X (and all the controls linked to it) sharing the value of the last child in the FlowThru composite, we must update the ctrl_X ---> ctrl_processedData link! In other words, we need to unlink ctrl_X from ctrl_processedData of the previous last child MarSystem, and re-link it to the ctrl_processedData of the new last child of the composite. For that we could think that the following way would cut it:

@example
ctrl_processedData = msys->getctrl("xxx/lastChildMsys2/mrs_realvec/processedData");
ctrl_X->unlink();
ctrl_X->linkTo(ctrl_processedData);
@end example

However, calling unlink in this way (i.e. the way implemented in "part I" of the refactoring) would unlink ctrl_X from all the other linked controls (i.e. ctrl_W, ctrl_Y, etc) and relinking it alone to the new ctrl_processedData (i.e. represented as (2) below) from the new last child. All the other previously linked controls would still be linked to the same ctrl_processedData of the previous last child in the composite. The only way around this would be to manually keep track of what links would have to be unlinked and relinked to the new control.

Graphically:

@example
ctrl_processedData(1) <--- ctrl_Y
                             ^
                             |--- ctrl_W <--- ctrl_Z


ctrl_processedData(2) <--- ctrl_X
@end example


As it is easy to imagine, any minimally complex network of multiple-nested MarSystems and linked controls would be totally insane to manage! Here's an example of what we would have to explicitly do to achieve what we really wanted:

@example
ctrl_processedData = msys->getctrl("xxx/lastChildMsys2/mrs_realvec/processedData");
ctrl_X->unlink();
ctrl_X->linkTo(ctrl_processedData_X);
ctrl_Y->unlink();
ctrl_Y->linkTo(ctrl_X);
ctrl_W->unlink();
ctrl_W->linkTo(ctrl_X);
ctrl_Z->unlink();
ctrl_Z->linkTo(ctrl_W); //we must remind that this one was originally connected to W and not directly to X! :-\
@end example

(OK, if you managed to follow me till here without getting
suicidal tendencies or falling totally asleep, please go to
http://marsyas.info/community/getting_involved and welcome aboard
;-)).

The best way to make Marsyas solve this automatically for us was to keep a simple record of the original link orders, as explained above. If we know who originally linked to whom, it's then easy to unlink a control from a set of controls, but keep all the controls that were originally connected (or indirectely connected) still attached to it. So after the "part II" of the refactoring, if we want to reconnect ctrl_X (and all the controls originally linked to it) to the new last child in the composite, we would only need to do:

@example
ctrl_X->unlinkFromTarget(); //this is in fact not needed! See below...
ctrl_processedData = msys->getctrl("xxx/lastChildMsys2/mrs_realvec/processedData");
ctrl_X->linkTo(ctrl_processedData);
@end example

As it's possible to see, the unlink() method is no longer used (it was deprecated) and we should now use unlinkFromTarget() for achieving the desired result. By "target" I mean the following: everytime we link a control *to* another control (and here we start to see the importance of the order of linking, other than the known issue of which control gets its value overwriten by the other as explained above), we are directly "targeting" or linking to that control. So for the case of ctrl_X, when we linked it to ctrl_processedData, we made the latter the "target" of ctrl_X. As we can see, each control, even if linked to any arbitrary number of controls, only has one "target" control, i.e. the one it was originaly linked to. So, when we call ctrl_X->unlinkFromTarget() above, we are just unlinking ctrl_X from its target (i.e. ctrl_processedData(1) and any other controls that have that control as their target) but keeping the links with all the other controls that have ctrl_X as their direct or indirect target. Graphically we get:

@example
ctrl_processedData(1)

ctrl_processedData(2) <--- ctrl_X <--- ctrl_Y
                                ^
                                |--- ctrl_W <--- ctrl_Z
@end example


In truth, we do not even need to explicitly call unlinkFromTarget() before linking ctrl_X to the new target. Since each linked control can only have one target, re-linking it to other control will automatically unlink it from its previous target.

All these linked controls can be seen as a directed graph problem (but please do not suggest me using Ncuts in it ;-)), where there is no possibility of existing loops (e.g. attemping to link ctrl_X with ctrl_Z, as depicted above, would do nothing, since it's very easy to detect that they are already linked - we just need to compare the pointers to the respective MarControlValue of each MarControl: if they point to the same object it means the controls are already linked, so very easy and efficient to avoid any loops!).

In any case, if we need to completely unlink a control from all its linked controls (regardeless of targets etc - i.e. the way the now deprecated unlink() method worked), we can simply use:

@example
ctrl_X->unlinkFromAll();
@end example

Although not so usefull as the former version of unlinking, there are some situations in Marsyas where we need this (if you dare or if you are really curious about this, you can have a look ate MarSystem copy constructor and at the put() method ;-)).

As a conclusion, if when constructing networks of linked controls in Marsyas we take into mind the importance of the linking order, it's really easy to construct semantically meaninful links that will allow easy reconfiguration of MarSystem networks. Actually, this is a mandatory feature if we want in the future to have MarSystem insertion/deletion at runtime, without messing up all the linked controls in the network.

@node Scheduling in Marsyas
@subsection Scheduling in Marsyas

Scheduling is the art of delaying actions (events) until later periods in time.
In Marsyas time and event are are more general than many other systems. This
allows for a wide range of user specified control rates and actions.

@subsubsection Time
Time is simply a counter. What it counts is up to the writer of a new timer
class. The two supplied timers, TmSampleCount and TmRealTime, count audio samples
and system micro-seconds respectively.

There are a number of issues surrounding control rates in Marsyas and most other
time-aware processing systems. Marsyas' primary task is to process audio data.
This data passes through the network in buffers of size N. Usually the network
is prompted to process the buffer of N samples by an outer loop. During
processing control of the network is lost as the buffer of data passes through
each MarSystem object. The scheduler checks for and dispatches events when the
network is ticked and before the buffer of data passes through the network.
Events are therefore dispatched at the start of each buffer processed.

Event dispatch is therefore governed by the audio sample rate. Ultimately every
custom timer bears some relation to the audio sample rate. Since events are
dispatched at the start of each tick, events are actually dispatched at a rate
of every N samples. This implies that there is a granularity on event dispatch
based on the sample rate and buffer size. If an event is to be dispatched at a
point in time that falls inside a buffer, ie at 256 for a buffer size of 512
samples, then that event will not be dispatched until the next buffer boundary
at which point its dispatch time will be <= current counter time.

We might wish to have sample accurate event timing. After all, there are other
audio processing systems that can claim the accuracy we might desire. The major
obstacle to achieving this accuracy is due to Marsyas' dataflow architecture.
When a buffer of N samples passes through the network it is processed multiple
times (normally once by each object in the network). This means that each sample
recurs a number of times equal to the number of Marsystems that process it.
More specifically, if the time is T when the network is ticked, then after the
first MarSystem processes the buffer of N samples time will be at T+N. The next
MarSystem will start processing the buffer at time T. In this way, time bounces
between T and T+N as the buffer passes through the network. This situation makes
it exceedingly difficult to make the network consistent for events that occur
between T and T+N. If a control value C is to be changed at time T+K where 0<K<N
then for C to remain consistent for all MarSystem objects that might be
interested then it must be changed to the previous state at the start of buffer
processing then to the new value at the event time - each time the buffer is
processed. This would be somewhat difficult and computationally expensive to
accomplish within the dataflow model. For this reason the scheduler only
dispatches events on buffer boundaries - when the network is ticked - as this is
the only point when all MarSystems are at the same point in time.

In many systems multiple control rates are desireable. Consider two timers based
on separate sample rates such as 44.1kHz and 12.34kHz. Since both of these rates
are regular, that is they repeat at a constant rate, then a simple conversion
function can be used to convert between the two rates. By converting one of the
rates to the other a single timer can be used in the scheduler. However for
other timers an errorless conversion function may not be possible. Consider a
control rate based on detecting someone tapping a drum stick. The rate of
tapping could be described as irregular because it is not known exactly when the
next tap will happen. Combining this timer with the audio sample rate creates
the problem that no perfect conversion function is possible that can compute
what the sample time will be for N taps in the future. In Marsyas this problem
is bypassed through the support of multiple timers. Events are therefore posted
on the timers they are specified on and no timer conversion takes place.

@subsubsection Event
An event is simply something that happens at some point in time. In Marsyas
an event is a class that contains a user-defined function. What this function
contains is up to the writer and can act on the Marsyas network or outside of
it. Marsyas is not threaded and neither is the scheduler so the scheduler will
wait for the event to complete its action before resuming. Be careful not to
do excessive processing during the dispatch of an event.

@node Components of the Marsyas Scheduler
@subsection Components of the Marsyas Scheduler

The scheduler is made up of a collection of files from those used by
the scheduler to those that support it. The classes directly related to
the scheduler along with their relationships is shown in
@xref{fig:asch1}.

@subsubsection MarSystem
Each MarSystem object has its own scheduler. This makes it possbile to
post events on the MarSystem object directly. However, once a MarSystem
is contained within another (within a Composite) it no longer responds
to tick messages. This means that the schedulers in any of the contained
objects will remain dormant. Therefore the only operational scheduler in
a network is the one in the MarSystem being ticked.

Posting events on the scheduler is done through a number of
@code{updctrl} methods. Each one takes a @code{TmTime} class as its
first parameter.

@example
void @b{updctrl}(EvEvent* me);
void @b{updctrl}(TmTime t, EvEvent* ev);
void @b{updctrl}(TmTime t, Repeat rep, EvEvent* ev);
void @b{updctrl}(TmTime t, std::string cname, MarControlPtr control);
void @b{updctrl}(TmTime t, Repeat rep, std::string cname, MarControlPtr control);
@end example

Additional methods for adding and removing timers and discovering the
current time on a timer are available. The @code{updtimer} method is
provided to modify timer parameters at run-time.

@example
mrs_natural @b{getTime}(std::string timer_name);
void @b{updtimer}(std::string cname, TmControlValue value);
void @b{addTimer}(std::string class_name, std::string identifier);
void @b{addTimer}(TmTimer* t);
void @b{removeTimer}(std::string name);
@end example

@subsubsection Scheduler
It is the schedulers job to see that events are passed to the correct
timer when they are posted. On each network tick the scheduler prompts
each of the timers it manages to dispatch their pending events.

@subsubsection Timers
Timers define a control rate on which events may be scheduled. It is
also the job of the timer to manage a queue of events and dispatch them
at their scheduled dispatch time.

Creating a custom timer is simply a matter of defining its control rate,
its units (ie seconds), and implementing a function to count the elapsed
time between ticks. See the @file{TmSampleCount} timer as an example of
a custom timer.

@subsubsection Events
Events are the actions that happen at specified points in time. In
Marsyas events inherit from the @file{EvEvent}. Custom events are
constructed by inheriting from @file{EvEvent} and overriding the
@code{dispatch} and @code{clone} methods.

The overridden @code{EvEvent::dispatch} method is where the custom
event action is defined. Since Marsyas is not threaded the network will
block during dispatch. This could result in breaks in audio for
real-time audio if the action takes too much time.

The @code{clone} method is intended to be used by the @file{TmTimer} to
copy the event when it's posted. This would force the user to take care
of its deletion and avoid confusion about who must do this. At this time
clone is not used for this task so that once an @file{EvEvent} is posted
it is under the control of the @file{TmTimer} it was posted on. It
should not be reposted or deleted by the user. The search is on for a
better solution.

@file{EvEvent} supports repetition without having to create new
events. The @code{setRepeat(Repeat r)} method takes a @file{Repeat}
object that defines how to repeat the event. The default behaviour is
no repetition. A true value from the @code{repeat()} method tells the
scheduler to repeat the event. This method queries the supplied
@file{Repeat} object. The @code{getRepeatInterval()} returns the repeat
rate. The @code{repeat_interval(string interval)} may be used to convert
the supplied interval to a count. It is used in the
@code{EvEvent::doRepeat()} method.

@subsubsection Repeat
Repetition of events is defined using the @file{Repeat} class. This
class is simply a tuple of the repetition time interval and repetition
count. There are three ways to define repetition. @code{Repeat()}
defines no repetition. @code{Repeat(string interval)} defines an
infinite repetition at a rate specified by the supplied interval.
@code{Repeat(string interval, mrs_natural count)} defines a finite
repetition of count repeats to occur every interval.

Time is specified as a single string without a timer name. It is assumed
that the specified interval time will be meaningful on the timer that
the event is posted in.

@subsubsection TmTime
Time is specified using the @file{TmTime} class as
@code{TmTime(string timer, string time)}. The first parameter is the
name of the timer on which the second parameter has meaning. As an
example, @code{TmTime("TmSampleCount/Virtual","5s")} specifies 5 seconds
from the point of time it is used on the TmSampleCount timer called
Virtual.

@subsubsection TmTimerManager
Rather than instantiating timers and adding them to the scheduler using
the @code{MarSystem::addtimer(TmTimer* tmr)} method, timers may be
specified and added by name using the
@code{MarSystem::addtimer(string name, string ident)} method where name
is the timer name, ie TmSampleCount, and ident is the unique identifier,
ie Virtual. Of course, if the timer name is not known then this method
will fail. New timers can be added to the factory using the method
laid out in @file{TmTimerManager.cpp}. @xref{archtmrfac,,Timer Factory}.
@c @ref{Writing a new Timer,Timer Factory}.
