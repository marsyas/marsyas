We should check this and get rid of it


GENERAL



- Figure out CPACK for distribution packaging (maybe we really need
to start distributing binaries)

- Add all the apps and Qt4Apps after weeding out dead code


CMAKE BROKENNESS


- Add the CMakeLists.txt files for the Ruby and possibly
Java, Lua bindings  (maybe post-0.3)

- fix the linking for the vamp plugins.  (sness is doing this)


DOCS / USABILITY

- begin docs on interactive python use.


OTHER

- Test Qt4 with MSVC, mingw, cygwin

- Test on as many different systems with as many different compile
configurations as we can to make sure everything works

-- ask Gustavo about speakerSeg


RENAMINGS  (between 0.2.17 and 0.3)
- notEmpty -> hasData
- done -> make sure it really is just "done" stuff.
